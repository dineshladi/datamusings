    "## Long Tail Problem\n",
    "Why are recommendation systems necessary ?. A phenomenon called long tail makes them necessary. Traditionally, physical delivery systems have scarcity of resources and stores have limited shelf space. It is not possible to show all his choices. On the other hand, online stores can show all the choices to the customers. There can be millions of products in the cateogry you are interested in. Suddenly, we have the problem of **abundance**. The distinction between physical and online stores is called long tail phenomenon. This problem forces the institutions to recommend items to users."

    "    5. Year of release\n",
    "    \n",
    "Sometimes items can be document/images/webpage. There are different ways of extracting features from the item based on its type. For example, extracting features from documents starts from eliminating stop words, then compute TFIDF socre for each word in the documents. The words with the highest score characterise the document. We will use different type of metrics to measure similarty (Jaccard Distance, Cosine Similiarty etc). Items profiles can be represented as vectors with different components. "
